To use:

1. Compile and run run.Main.
2. Move pieces (currently both sides are human controlled) by typing in the square to move from and to
	in algebraic notation (e.g. to move white's king's pawn, type "e2 e4" ["e2e4" also works]).
	Pieces on the board are denoted by a smaller case character to denote color ("w" for white, "b" for black)
	and an upper case character to denote piece type ( P - pawn, R - rook, N - knight, B - bishop, Q - queen, K - king).
3. Useful commands:
	A. valid "square" - list positions on the board that the piece on "square" can move to
						(replace "square" with algebraic notation of piece's position).
	B. quit or exit - exit the game.
